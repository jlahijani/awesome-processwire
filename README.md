## Why ProcessWire?
* Free and open-source (an unbelievable value!)
* Uses classic LAMP stack (it still rocks)
* Developed consistently since 2003 (and only getting better)
* Updated **nearly every single Friday** (see the [dev branch](https://github.com/processwire/processwire/tree/dev))
* Fun (and perhaps addictive; seriously I've been using it for over 10 years straight)
* Simple (fields, templates and pages can pretty much do everything)
* Fast (built for speed)
* Secure (a 10 year old, neglected ProcessWire site won't get hacked)
* Developer-oriented (but easy for non-technical users to manage content)
* Unopinionated (do things your way)
* Completely markup agnostic on the frontend (for the OCD people out there)
* Well architected OOP and API (it's a work of art)
* Powerful hook system (modify core functionality with ease)
* Strong data relationships (relate pages with each other)
* Everything is a custom field (no 'metadata' like WordPress)
* Multi-lingual capability (a native feature)
* Friendly community (from all parts of the planet)
* Small but high-quality (less is more; for example, one great caching module instead of 347)
* The lead developer is a super human "10x" developer, excellent writer with Cal Ripken-like dedication (rare to find)

## Frontend Recommendations

**Keep it simple!** Use a CSS framework combined with Alpine.js and HTMX and you'll have 99% of what you need on the frontend.  Embrace the concept of [HTML Over The Wire](https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/html-over-the-wire/) and consider ditching Node-based solutions for radical simplicity.

### CSS Frameworks
* [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/): CSS framework with JavaScript components
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): CSS framework with JavaScript components
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS utility framework (no JavaScript components); [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) is strongly recommended for the JavaScript components

### Libraries
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): JavaScript library (or just use vanilla JavaScript)
* [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/): Lightweight JavaScript framework
* [HTMX](https://htmx.org/): HTML Over The Wire library
